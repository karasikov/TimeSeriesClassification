  abstract = {There has been a strong trend lately in face processing research away
	from geometric models towards appearance models. Appearance-based
	methods employ dimensionality reduction to represent faces more compactly
	in a low-dimensional subspace which is found by optimizing certain
	criteria. The most popular appearance-based method is the method
	of eigenfaces that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to represent
	faces in a low-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of
	the covariance matrix of the data corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
	(i.e., directions of maximum variance). Recently, Random Projection
	(RP) has emerged as a powerful method for
	
	dimensionality reduction. It represents a computationally simple and
	efficient method that preserves the structure of the data without
	introducing significant distortion. Despite its simplicity, RP has
	promising theoretical properties that make it an attractive tool
	for dimensionality reduction. Our focus in this paper is on investigating
	the feasibility of RP for face recognition. In this context, we have
	performed a large number of experiments using three popular face
	databases and comparisons using PCA. Our experimental results illustrate
	that although RP represents faces in a random, low-dimensional subspace,
	its overall performance is comparable to that of PCA while having
	lower computational requirements and being data independent.},
