# Feature-based time-series classification

Here, we consider a time series as a sequence of its segments approximated by parametric models (e.g. autoregressive model, discrete Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform).
The parameters of the approximating models are used as time-series' features.  
Then, we generalize this approach and use the distributions of the parameters estimated for models approximating different time-series' segments.  

The proposed approach is applied to the problem of human activity recognition from accelerometer data.
